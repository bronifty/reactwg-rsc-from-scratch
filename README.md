# Dan's RSC From Scratch Tutorial With Some Extra Credit Stuff

[- cf.](https://github.com/reactwg/server-components/discussions/5)

### Instructions To Run This

1. You need to use Node 18 LTS with undici fetch (.nvmrc should auto set your node version; if not, you need to update it)

```bash
fnm use 18
```

2. npm or yarn for your install and start script. You can start ssr and rsc separately if you like; please note: ssr has a dependency on rsc, so you want to start rsc first.
3. navigate around, check your network tab and the console both in the server terminal as well as the browser console.
